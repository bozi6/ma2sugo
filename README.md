Added key_key_executorbutton.html, because the help function on executorbuttons, didn't work.
(pressing ALT-GR-H + one executor button on executor fader button gives error.)
Added this file problem solved.

Replaced: menu-tools-3-4.png with menu-tools-3-5.png solved the black text problem, on toolbar picture.
Now you can see the text in the toolbar frame.
